# Stock_Analysis

## Steve would like to recieve an analysis of stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. After using Excel and VBA to utilize a timer, arrays, if statements and loops the analysis was performed. Although, the initial code was not ompitally formatted to receive the results as soon as possible. Thus, the code was refractored to reduce time in which the results are received.
